prerequisites:
	First disable the firewall on the machine used for running server code.
	Check the IP addres and port number in socket's connect() and bind() functions in all the files.
	Make sure all the code have the IP and port number of the machine running the server code.

Steps:
	Run the server code first and enter the multiplicand an multiplier in integer base 10 format.(The usual numbers like -5, 3 ,4...)
	Run the multiplicand code next on another machine. 
	Run the multiplier code on yet another machine.

1. The multiplicand code will display the values of A and S. It will also display the packed string which is sent back to the server.
2. The multiplier code will display the value of P
3. The server code will display the connection received from both the clients. Finally, it also outputs the answer in binary format.
